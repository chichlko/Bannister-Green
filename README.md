### Environment Capture
This represents initial forays into 'real-time' environment capture, beginning with audio. First things first, to get going on this I stood on the shoulders of Mark Jay:<br>

He also provides some great youtube presentations at:

While this runs okay on my laptop I ended up switching off any microphone noise/echo cancellation and I had to keep my voice low, otherwise I would run into rails quickly enough.  Also, the update rate, at just over five updates per second, is to low to properly capture all speech nuances; Iâ€™m hoping that decoupling from waveform and spectrum real-time plotting in later versions will raise this to suitable levels.<p>
You're prompted to provide a filename for the spectrogram (a .npydat extension is added if not already there).  I'm hoping to use these to help train a neural net, in particular, a self-constructing version which came out of my PhD work.
